## How to play the game?
I decide to compile the whole source code in a JAR file, so it's easiest to run. For this game, you need to have Java (8) installed and then use the following command:

```console
java -jar PSL_Mineswipper_Challenge.jar
```
Then you would see something like this:

 You need to enter the input in the asked order separated by a blank space between them:   
 1) The number of rows in the board.  
 2) The number of columns in the board.  
 3) The number of mines in the board.
 
 There is an example of the input, for a 8 x 8 board with 5 mines:

Start playing minesweeper and have fun!
